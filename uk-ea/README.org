#+TITLE: UK Environment Agency Data

* Data Source

The UK EA has LIDAR data for the UK, and makes it available in tiles that are easy to process. They got a lot of press for open sourcing it in Oct 2015. Main links:

- Info page: https://data.gov.uk/dataset/lidar-composite-dsm-1m1
- Useful query page: http://environment.data.gov.uk/ds/survey#/download

* Grabbing Data

They have a nice webpage that lets you download zip tiles of data files. It's easy to just pull the tiles you want: 

- Go to: http://environment.data.gov.uk/ds/survey
- Select a tile
- At the bottom they list different data products
- I've been using the LIDAR Composite DTMs at different resolutions (with no coverage?)

** Automating grabbing
It looks like the web page links are run through javascript to format the requests to a backend rest server. Using wireshark, I saw the below http request for grabbing TQ38 DTM at 50cm spatial resolution (360MB):

http://www.geostore.com/environment-agency/rest/product/download/8007

The links is wget'able. Downloading file 8008 resolved to another tile (494MB).
